SelectedItemsBindingDemo
========================

An example of how to bind the SelectedItems property of an ItemsControl in WPF to a ViewModel

The origin of all this and a good explanation of how it all works can be found at

The original example demo is still included in the code base, but the code has been reorganised a bit so that it can be published as a utility library in a NuGet package. I'm hoping you'll find it as useful as I have done, and making it available as a NuGet package should ease integration with your production code!
